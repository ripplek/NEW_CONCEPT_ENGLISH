    When will the writer see the play?

    'The play may begin at any moment,' I said.
    'It may have begun already,' Susan answered.
    I hurried to the ticket office. 'May I have two tickets please?' I asked.
    'I'm sorry, we've sold out,' the girl said.
    'What a pity!' Susan exclaimed.
    Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office.
    'Can I return these two tickets?' he asked.
    'Certainly,' the girl said.
    I went back to the ticket office at once.
    'Could I have those two tickets please?' I asked.
    'Certainly,' the girl said, 'but they're for next Wednesday's performance. Do you still want them?'
    'I might as well have them,' I said sadly.
