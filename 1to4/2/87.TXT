           A perfect alibi
       极好的不在犯罪现场的证据

    First listen and then answer the question.
    听录音，然后回答以下问题。
    What was wrong with the man's story?

      'At the time the murder was committed, I was travelling on the 8 o'clock train to London,' said the man.
      'Do you always catch such an early train?' asked the inspector.
      'Of course I do,' answered the man. 'I must be at work at 10 o'clock. My employer will confirm that I was there on time.'
      'Would a later train get you to work on time?' asked the inspector.
      'I suppose it would, but I never catch a later train.'
      'At what time did you arrive at the station?'
      'At ten to eight. I bought a paper and waited for the train.'
      'And you didn't notice anything unusual?'
      'Of course not.'
      'I suggest,' said the inspector, 'that you are not telling the truth. I suggest that you did not catch the 8 o'clock train, but that you caught the 8.25 which would still get you to work on time. You see, on the morning of the murder, the 8 o'clock train did not run at all. It broke down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line.'

参考译文

    “在凶杀发生的时候，我正坐在8点钟开往伦敦的火车上。”那人说。
    “您总是赶这样早的火车？”探长问。
    “当然是的，”那人回答。“我必须在10点钟上班，我的雇主会证明我是按时到了那儿的。”
    “晚一点儿的车也能送您按时上班吗？”
    “我认为可以，但我从来不乘晚一点儿的车。”
    “您几点钟到的火车站？”
    “7点50分。我买了张报纸，等着车来。”
    “您没有注意到有什么异常情况发生吗？”
    “当然没有。”
    “我提醒您，”探长说，“您讲的不是实话。您乘的不是8点钟的火车，而是8点25分的，这次车同样能使您按时上班。您看，在凶杀发生的那天早晨，8点钟的那次车根本没有发。它在芬格林车站出了故障而被取消了。”
