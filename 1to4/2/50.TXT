            Taken for a ride
               乘车兜风

    First listen and then answer the question.
    听录音，然后回答以下问题。
    Why did the writer not get off the bus at Woodford Green?

    I love travelling in the country, but I don't like losing my way.
    I went on an excursion recently, but my trip took me longer than I expected.
      'I'm going to Woodford Green,' I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, 'but I don't know where it is.'
      'I'll tell you where to get off.' answered the conductor.
      I sat in the front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside. After some time, the bus stopped. Looking round, I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.
      'You'll have to get off here,' the conductor said. 'This is as far as we go.'
      'Is this Woodford Green?' I asked.
      'Oh dear,' said the conductor suddenly. 'I forgot to put you off.'
      'It doesn't matter,' I said. 'I'll get off here.'
      'We're going back now,' said the conductor.
      'Well, in that case, I prefer to stay on the bus,' I answered.

    我喜欢在乡间旅行，但却不愿意迷路。最近我作了一次短途旅行，但这次旅行所花费的时间比我预计的要长。
    “我要去伍德福德草地，”我一上车就对售票员说，“但我不知道它在那儿。”
    “我来告诉您在哪儿下车，”售票员回答说。
    我坐在汽车的前部，以便饱览农村风光。过了一些时候，车停了。我环视了一下身旁，惊奇地发现车里就只剩我一个乘客了。
    “您得在这里下车，”售票员说，“我们的车就到此为止了。”
    “这里是伍德福德草地吗？”我问道。
    “哎呀，”售票员突然说，“我忘了让您下车了。”
    “没关系，”我说，“我就在这儿下吧。”
    “我们现在要返回去，”售票员说。
    “好吧，既然如此，我还是留在车上吧。”我回答说。
