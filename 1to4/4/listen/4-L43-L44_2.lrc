[00:13.13]Custom has not commonly been regarded as a subject of any great moment.\n

[00:20.04]The inner workings of our own brains we feel to be uniquely worthy of investigation,\n
[au:]我们觉得,只有我们大脑内部的活动情况才值得研究,\n
[00:26.68]but custom,we have a way of thinking,is behaviour at is most commonplace.\n
[au:]至于风俗呢,只是些司空见惯的行为而已.\n
[00:33.12]As a matter of fact,it is the other way around.\n
[au:]事实上,情况正好相反.\n
[00:37.74]Traditional custom, taken the world over, is a mass of detailed behaviour,\n
[au:]从世界范围来看,传统风俗是由许多细节性的习惯行为组成,\n
[00:43.68]more astonishing than what any one person can ever evolve in individual actions,\n
[au:]它比任何个人养成的行为都更加引人注目,\n
[00:49.87]no matter how aberrant.\n

[00:51.78]Yet that is a rather trivial aspect of the matter.\n
[au:]这只是问题的一个次要的侧面.\n
[00:55.70]The fact of first-rate importance\n
[au:]最重要的是,\n
[00:58.58]is the predominant role that custom plays in experience and in belief,\n
[au:]风俗在实践中和信仰上所起的举足轻重的作用,\n
[01:03.64]and the very great varieties it may manifest.\n
[au:]以及它所表现出来的极其丰富多彩的形式.\n
[01:06.93]No man ever looks at the world with pristine eyes.\n
[au:]没有一个人是用纯洁而无偏见的眼光看待世界.\n
[01:12.47]He sees it edited by a definite set of custo- ms and institutions and ways of thinking.\n

[01:19.10]Even in his philosophical probings he cannot go behind these stereotypes.\n
[au:]甚至在哲学领域的探索中人们也无法超越这些定型的框框.\n
[01:25.05]his very concepts of the true and the false,\n
[au:]人们关于真与伪的概念,\n
[01:28.39]will still have reference to his particular traditional customs.\n
[au:]依然和特定的传统风俗有关.\n
[01:32.15]John Dewey has said in all seriousness,\n
[au:]约翰.杜威曾经非常严肃地指出:\n
[01:36.24]that the part played by custom in shaping the behaviour of the individual,\n
[au:]风俗在形成个人行为方面所起的作用,\n
[01:40.69]as against any way in which he can affect traditional custom,\n

[01:44.46]is as the proportion of the total vocabulary of his mother tongue,\n

[01:59.60]that have had the opportunity to develop autonomously,\n
[au:]自发形成的社会秩序时,\n
[02:02.65]the figure becomes no more than an exact and matter-of -fact observation.\n
[au:]杜威的比喻就是他实事求是观察得来的形象化的说法.\n
[02:07.96]The life history of the individual is first and foremost an accommodation,\n
[au:]个人的生活史首先就是一个融合史,\n
[02:13.73]to the patterns and standards traditionally handed down in his community.\n

[02:18.64]From the moment of his birth,\n
[au:]从他呱呱坠地时起,\n
[02:20.84]the customs into which he is born shape his experience and behaviour.\n

[02:34.74]its habits are his habits,its beliefs his beliefs,\n
[au:]他的社团的习惯就是他的习惯,他的社团的信仰就是他的信仰,\n
[02:40.29]ts impossibilities his impossibilities.\n

[02:44.01]Every child that is born into his group will share them with him,\n

[02:53.24]can ever achieve the thousandth part.\n
[au:]与他就很少有相同的风俗.\n
[02:56.08]There is no social problem,\n
[au:]没有任何一个社会问题,\n
[02:58.34]it is more incumbent upon us to understand than this of the role of custom.\n
[au:]比得上风俗的作用问题更要求我们对它理解.\n
[03:04.10]Until we are intelligent as to its laws and varieties,\n
[au:]直到我们理解了风俗的规律性和多样性,\n
[03:08.50]the main complicating facts of human life must remain unintelligible.\n

[03:30.69]there be no preferent- ial weighting of one or another of the items in the series,it selects for its consideration.\n
[au:]对诸多因素不能厚此薄彼偏向某一方面,有选择地去加以考虑.\n
[03:38.17]In all the less controversial fields,\n
[au:]在一切争议较小的领域里\n
[03:41.39]like the study of cacti or termites or the nature of nebulae,\n
[au:]如对仙人掌、白蚁或星云性质的研究,\n
[03:47.13]the necessary method of study is to group the relevant material,\n

[03:51.87]and to take note of all possible variant forms and conditions.\n

[au:]用这种方法,我们完全掌握了天文学的规律,\n
[04:01.66]or of the habits of the social insects, let us say.\n

[04:05.58]It is only in the study of man himself that the major social sciences,\n
[au:]只是在对人类自身的研究中,各主要的社会学科,\n
[04:11.24]have substituted the study of one local variation,that of Western civilization.\n
[au:]才用对一个局部地区各种情况(如对西方文明)的研究来代替对全人类的研究.\n
[04:17.18]Anthropology was by definition impossible,\n
[au:]只要有以下几点存在,人类学按其定义来说就无法存在,这几点是:\n
[04:22.26]as long as these distinctions between ourselves and the primitive,\n

[04:37.86]where we no longer set our own belief against our neighbour's superstition.\n
[au:]不用自己的信仰去反对我们邻居的迷信.\n
[04:42.92]It was necessary to recognize that\n
[au:]必须认识到,\n
[04:46.12]these institutions which are based on the same premises,let us say the supernatural,must be considered together,our own among the rest.\n
[au:]这些建立在相同前提基础上的风俗,暂且可以说是超自然的东西,必须放在一起加以考虑,我们自己的风俗和其他民族的风俗都在其中.\n
