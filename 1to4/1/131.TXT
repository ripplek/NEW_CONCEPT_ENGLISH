Listen to the tape then answer this question. What's the problem about deciding on a holiday?
听录音，然后回答问题。决定如何度假有什么为难的地方？

MARTIN: Where are you going to 
        spend your holidays this year,
        Gary?
GARY:   We may go abroad.
        I'm not sure.
        My wife wants go to Egypt.
        I'd like to there, too.
        We can't make up our minds.
MARTIN: Will you travel by sea or air?
GARY:   We may travel by sea.
MARTIN: It's cheaper, isn't it?
GARY:   It may be cheaper.
        but it takes a long time.
MARTIN: I'm sure you'll enjoy 
        yourselves.
GART:   Don't be so sure.
        We might not go anywhere.
        My wife always worries too much.
        Who's going to look after the 
        dog?
        Who's going to look after the
        house?
        Who's going to look after the
        garden?
        We have this problem every year.
        in the end, we stay at home
        and look after everything!

马丁：加里，今年你们打算去哪里度假？
加里：我们可能到国外去，但我不敢肯定。
      我妻子想到埃及去，我也想去那儿。
      我们还拿不定主意。
马丁：你们乘船去，还是乘飞机去？
加里：我们可能乘船去。
马丁：这更便宜些，是吗？
加里：可能是便宜些，但花的时间长。
马丁：我肯定你们一定会玩得很痛快。
加里：别那么肯定。我们可能哪里也去不成。
      我妻子总是担心那的。谁来照看狗啦，
      谁来看管房子啦，谁来照料花园啦，
      我们每年都碰到这类问题。末了，    
      我们呆在家里来照看一切。
