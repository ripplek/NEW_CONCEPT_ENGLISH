听录音，然后回答问题。为什么母亲感到尴尬？

    Last week, my four-year-old daughter, Sally, was invited to a children's party. I decided to take her by train. Sally was very excited because she had never travelled on a train before. She sat near the window and asked questions about everything she saw. Suddenly, a middle-age lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally. 'Hello, little girl,' she said. Sally did not answer, but looked at her curiously. The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat. After the train had left the station, the lady opened her handbag and took to her power compact. She then began to make up her face. 'Why are you doing that?' Sally asked. 'To make myself beautiful,' the lady answered. She put away her compact and smiled kindly. 'But you are still ugly,' Sally said. Sally was amused, but I was very embarrassed!

    上周，我4岁的女儿萨莉被邀请去参加一个儿童聚会。我决定带她乘火车去。萨莉非常激动，因为她从未乘过火车。她靠车窗坐着，对她所看到的一切都要问个明白。突然，一个中年妇女上了火车，坐在萨莉的对面。“你好，小姑娘，”她说。萨莉没回答，却好奇地看着她。那位妇女穿着一件蓝色的大衣，戴着一顶大而滑稽的帽子。火车开出车站后，那位妇女找开了手提包，拿出了粉盒。然后她开始打扮起来。“你为什么要那样做呢？”萨莉问。“为了把自己打扮漂亮啊，”那位妇女答道。她放好了粉盒，慈祥地微笑着。“可是你仍然难看呀，”萨莉说。萨莉感到很有趣，而我却很尴尬。
