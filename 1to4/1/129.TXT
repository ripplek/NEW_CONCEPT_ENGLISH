听录音，然后回答问题。安建议她的丈夫下次做什么？

ANN:       Look, Gary!
           That policeman's waving to 
           you.
           He wants you to stop.
POLICEMAN: Where do you think you are?
           On a race track?
           You must have been driving 
           at seventy miles an hour.
GARY:      I can't have been.
POLICEMAN: I was doing eighty
           when I overtook you.
POLICEMAN: Didn't you see the speed 
           limit?
GARY:      I'm afraid I didn't, officer.
           I must have been dreaming.
ANN:       He wasn't dreaming, officer.
           I was telling him to drive
           slowly.
GARY:      That's why I didn't see the 
           sign.
POLICEMAN: Let me see your driving 
           licence.
POLICEMAN: I won't charge you this time.
           But you'd better not do it 
           again!
GARY:      Thank you.
           I'll certainly be more
           careful.
ANN:       I told you to drive slowly,
           Gary.
GARY:      You always tell me to drive
           slowly, darling.
ANN:       Well, next time
           you'd better take my advice!
